The aim of nyom is to provide a general package for quark line contractions arising
in lattice QCD by making use of the Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF) written by
Edgar Solomonik and collaborators for efficient parallelisation.

I hope that the interface can be made sufficiently abstract to
support any kind of representation for the quark lines, such that
point and stochastic propagators as well as exact and stochastic
perambulators can be used to construct any possible diagram.

After the contractions have been defined (in a yet to be implemenented
scripting language), nyom will try to satisfy all dependencies
for the contractions by either reading propagators or calling
solver interfaces of arbitrary LQCD codes linked against it.

At the present moment (10.12.2016), functionality is still severely
limited and the project is in an exploratory stage to assess how
increasing levels of complexity will affect the efficiency of the
contraction algorithms employed by CTF.

nyom is being developed by Bartosz Kostrzewa at the Helmholtz 
Institut fuer Strahlen- und Kernphysik, Theory Division, 
University of Bonn, 53115 Bonn, Germany.
